Engineers, as practitioners of engineering, are people who invent, design, analyze, build, and test machines, systems, structures and 
materials to fulfill objectives and requirements while considering the limitations imposed by practicality, regulation, safety, and cost. 
The work of engineers forms the link between scientific discoveries and their subsequent applications to human and business needs and 
quality of life.
